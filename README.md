# Generate_SM_ET_Maps


Description: 

Generates maps of SM or ET from satellite images and the application of different models. 
The application of the model is basically performing matrix operations. Previously, satellite 
images must be modified to obtain the same projections and spatial resolutions.
To change the spatial resolutions, reprojection operations based on interpolations of the type: 
    -Nearest Neighbour
    -Bilinear
    -Cubic
    -Average

are used
